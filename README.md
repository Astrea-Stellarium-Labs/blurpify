# blurpify
A remake of a program that "blurpifies" images by converting them to shades of blurple.

# Basic example
```python
import blurplify

input_file = "path/to/file"
output_file = "path/to/output_file"

blurplify.convert(input_file, output_file)
```

# TODO
- Command line support
- Add support for animated GIFs
